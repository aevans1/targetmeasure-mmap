## Under Construction!

The file for the diffusion map code is src/diffusion_map.py. This uses scikitlearn extensively and is based largely on the ["pydiffmap" library](https://github.com/DiffusionMapsAcademics/pyDiffMap).

The examples available in rough .ipynb form are: 
-  a 2d toy system with position-dependent diffusion, see 2D_example.ipynb.
-  a 2d molecular dynamics example, alanine dipeptide with two dihedral angles, see aladip_2var.ipynb
-  a 4d molecular dynamics example, alanine dipeptide with four dihedral angles, see aladip_4var.ipynb

There are python scripts available for the `Ksum test' on the datasets, Ksumtest_datasetname.py

### In progress:
 - Uploading and cleaning up of plumed scripts for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum
 - Cleaning up the .ipynb for readability
