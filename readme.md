## Under Construction!

The main library for the diffusion map code is src/diffusion_map.py. This uses sci-kit-learn extensively and is based largely on the ["pydiffmap" library](https://github.com/DiffusionMapsAcademics/pyDiffMap).

The current example available is a 2d test system with position-dependent diffusion, see the 2D_example.ipynb.

### In progress:
 - Data and example code for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum
 - Cleaning up the repository
